# extract the give field number from a bounce.io email record dataset
#
# assumes input is a bounce.io csv file
#  field number is the index (1..NF) of the desired field.
#
# Note: The field separator is "," (one_double_quote comma one_double_quote) 
#       One known special case is handled when the URI href_text has ahs a comma as its value.
#       In that case the text is stored as "","" which will unintentially match the ","
#       field separator and produce 25 fields instead of 24.  In this case we just glue
#       field 22 and 23 back together again with ",". 
# Note: Treating the record seperator as "\n" (one_double_quote newline one_double_qute)
#       protects against broken records due to the inclusion of newlines in URLs
#       Including both the quote before and after newline has the added benefit of
#       cleaning the text so that only the first char of the first line and 
#       last char of the last line have a stray double quote caracter.
