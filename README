Routines for analyzing email records

The utilities are meant to help parse data sets and 
develop an understanding of patterns.

USAGE:

When working with bounce.io data sources it's convenient (and faster) to inspect
a smaller subset of records rather than the full dataset.  The commands are
filters and expect data on STDIN.  You can feed subsets of the source data file 
with a simple head command like this:

head -10 data/csv_data_file | bin/getdomain
